# Extraction of mechanical properties of materials through deep learning from instrumented indentation

The data and code for the paper [Extraction of mechanical properties of materials through deep learning from instrumented indentation, PNAS, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/03/13/1922210117).

## Data

All the data is in the folder [data](data).

## Code

All the code is in the folder [src](src). The code depends on the deep learning package [DeepXDE](https://github.com/lululxvi/deepxde).

- [data.py](src/data.py): The classes are used to read the data file. Remember to uncomment certain line in `ExpData` to scale `dP/dh`.
- [nn.py](src/nn.py): The main functions of multi-fidelity neural networks.
- [model.py](src/model.py): The fitting function method. Some parameters are hard-coded in the code, and you should modify them for different cases.
- [fit_n.py](src/fit_n.py): Fit strain-hardening exponent.
- [mfgp.py](src/mfgp.py): Multi-fidelity Gaussian process regression.
